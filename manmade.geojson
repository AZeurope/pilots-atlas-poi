It was built between 1979 and 1986 with funding from the central government of the Soviet Union. Its highest point reaches 368.5 m (1,209 ft), which makes it the third tallest tower in Europe (after the Ostankino Tower at 540 metres (1,772 ft) and the Kiev TV Tower at 385 metres (1,263 ft)) and the 14th tallest tower in the world. There is an observation platform at the height of 97 m, from which most of the city can be seen (and in good weather, the Gulf of Riga, and many of the city surroundings). The tower is built on an island called Zaķusala in the middle of the River Daugava, and the base of the tower is located about 7 m above mean sea level. The tower is said to be able to withstand extreme winds up to 44 m/s (98 mph) without any noticeable vibration."

At its completion five years later, it became the tallest free-standing structure in the Federal Republic of Germany at 331 metres (1,086 ft). Even without the height of the antenna at its top, the building is over 295 metres (968 ft) high, which still makes it Germany's second tallest structure, after the Fernsehturm Berlin (368 metres/1,207 feet). Its base, at 59 metres (194 ft) thick, is the widest of any similar structure in the world. The top of the tower can turn and provides a panoramic view of the Rhine Main area. For a number of years, the upper part of the structure housed a restaurant and discothèque, but since 1999, the Europaturm has been closed to the public. In September, 2004, the antenna at the top of the tower was replaced, increasing the total height to 337.5 metres (1,107.3 ft). The six-ton antenna was lifted to the top in two parts by helicopter."

The tower is 324 metres (1,063 ft) tall, about the same height as an 81-storey building. During its construction, the Eiffel Tower surpassed the Washington Monument to assume the title of the tallest human-made structure in the world, a title it held for 41 years, until the Chrysler Building in New York City was built in 1930. Because of the addition of the antenna atop the Eiffel Tower in 1957, it is now taller than the Chrysler Building by 5.2 metres (17 ft). Not including broadcast antennae, it is the second-tallest structure in France, after the Millau Viaduct."
