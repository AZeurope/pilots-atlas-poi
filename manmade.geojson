At 317 m (1,040 ft) the tower is the 60th-tallest building in the world. When it first opened, it was the 9th tallest building in the world, and 6th tallest building in the United States. It is also Georgia's tallest building, the tallest building in any U.S. state capital, and the tallest building in the United States outside of Chicago and New York City; however, the Wilshire Grand Tower in Los Angeles at 335 m (1,099 ft) would claim the title of the tallest building in the U.S. outside of New York and Chicago in 2017 if built as proposed. It has 55 stories of office space and was completed in 1992, when it was called NationsBank Plaza."

Even without the height of the antenna at its top, the building is over 295 metres (968 ft) high, which still makes it Germany's second tallest structure, after the Fernsehturm Berlin (368 metres/1,207 feet). Its base, at 59 metres (194 ft) thick, is the widest of any similar structure in the world. The top of the tower can turn and provides a panoramic view of the Rhine Main area. For a number of years, the upper part of the structure housed a restaurant and discothèque, but since 1999, the Europaturm has been closed to the public. In September, 2004, the antenna at the top of the tower was replaced, increasing the total height to 337.5 metres (1,107.3 ft). The six-ton antenna was lifted to the top in two parts by helicopter."

The tower is 324 metres (1,063 ft) tall, about the same height as an 81-storey building. During its construction, the Eiffel Tower surpassed the Washington Monument to assume the title of the tallest human-made structure in the world, a title it held for 41 years, until the Chrysler Building in New York City was built in 1930. Because of the addition of the antenna atop the Eiffel Tower in 1957, it is now taller than the Chrysler Building by 5.2 metres (17 ft). Not including broadcast antennae, it is the second-tallest structure in France, after the Millau Viaduct."

Old Trafford underwent several expansions in the 1990s and 2000s, including the addition of extra tiers to the North, West and East Stands, which served to return the ground almost to its original capacity of 80,000. Future expansion is likely to involve the addition of a second tier to the South Stand, which would raise the capacity to over 90,000.

There have been two stadia on the site: the present facility, and one that is called the Deutsches Stadion which was built for the aborted 1916 Summer Olympics. The current Olympiastadion was originally built for the 1936 Summer Olympics in the southern part of the Reichssportfeld (today Olympiapark Berlin). During World War II, the area suffered little damage. After the war, the British military occupation used the northern part of the Reichssportfeld as its headquarters until 1949. From 1951 to 2005, the Olympischer Platz had a giant antenna transmitting for all the portable radios in Berlin. Aside from its use as an Olympic stadium, the Olympiastadion has a strong footballing tradition. It was used for 3 matches in the 1974 FIFA World Cup. It hosted six matches, including the final, in the 2006 FIFA World Cup and was renovated for that reason. The German Cup final match is held each year at the Olympiastadion. The stadium sees use in other sports as well; at one point it held the world record for the attendance of a baseball game, thought to be over 110,000."

The track uses local roads that remain open to the public most of the year. The circuit, in its present configuration, is 13.629 kilometres (8.47 mi) long, making it one of the longest circuits in the world. Le Mans is a race where up to 85% of the time is spent on full throttle, meaning immense stress on engine and drivetrain components. However, the times spent reaching maximum speed also mean tremendous wear on the brakes and suspension as cars must slow from over 200 mph (320 km/h) to around 65 mph (100 km/h) for the end of Mulsanne in a short distance. Downforce in the era of Group C cars helped braking to some degree but presently cars are tending towards low downforce to seek higher speeds in the face of power limiting regulations.

It was originally named Lausitzring as it is located in the region the Germans call Lausitz (Lusatia), but was renamed \"EuroSpeedway Lausitz\" for better international communication. The EuroSpeedway has been in use for motor racing since 2000. Among other series, DTM (German Touring Car Championship) and Superbike World Championship take place there annually. The EuroSpeedway has a feature which is unique in continental Europe: a high-speed oval race track, as used in the United States by NASCAR and Indycar. The 3.2 km (2 mi) tri-oval (similar to Pocono Raceway) was used twice in 2001 and 2003 by open seater CART races named German 500 (won by Kenny Bräck and Sébastien Bourdais), plus a few British SCSA races. In 2005 and 2006, the German Formula Three Championship held races at the oval, with a pole position lap average speed of 251.761 km/h and a race average of 228.931 km/h. Capacity: 120,000."

Consequently, the Aérotrain could travel at very high speeds without the technical complexity and expensive tracks of magnetic levitation. This project was abandoned in 1977 due to lack of funding, the death of Jean Bertin, and the adoption of TGV by the French government as its high-speed ground transport solution."

        "comment": "The I-10 Twin Span Bridge, a nearly 6 mile causeway known locally as the Twin Spans, consists of two parallel trestle bridges. These parallel bridges cross the eastern end of Lake Pontchartrain in southernLouisiana from New Orleans, Louisiana to Slidell, Louisiana. The current twin spans were constructed in the second half of the 2000s after the original bridges were extensively damaged by Hurricane Katrina in 2005. The first span opened to eastbound traffic on July 9, 2009. On April 7, 2010, the second span was opened to traffic and the old twin spans were permanently closed to traffic. The approaches to the westbound lanes were completed with a ribbon cutting ceremony on September 8, 2011 and the opening of all 6 lanes the next morning. The original Twin Span bridges will be demolished in the near future, with portions being used for a public pier in Slidell, LA, and the rest as an underwater reef."

Designed in 1932 by engineer Eugenio Miozzi, and opened by Benito Mussolini in 1933 as Ponte Littorio, the bridge is the only access for road vehicles to the historical center of the capital city of Veneto. At the end of World War II it was renamed Ponte della Libertà to honour the end of the Fascist dictatorship and of the Nazi occupation. The bridge is the final end of the old public road 11 (Padana Superiore), it is 3.85 km (2.39 mi) long and has two lanes each way, with no emergency lane. It is built alongside the Venice Railroad Bridge, which was constructed in 1846, with two tracks each way, and is still in use."

Total length 3,264 metres (10,709 ft), its span is 2.75 miles (3.5 kilometres). The present-day structure is the second one on its site. From about 1854, there had been plans for a Tay crossing, to replace an early train-ferry. The first bridge, opened in 1878, was a single-track lattice design, notable for lightness and low cost. Its sudden collapse in a high wind on December 28th 1879 was one of the great engineering disasters of history, and its causes are still debated today. The second bridge was a double-track construction of iron and steel, opened in 1887 and still in service. In 2003, a strengthening and refurbishing project was recognised by a major award for the scale and difficulty of the work."

        "comment": "The High Coast Bridge is a suspension bridge crossing the mouth of the Ångermanälven river near Veda, on the border between the Härnösand and Kramfors municipalities in the province of Ångermanland in northern Sweden. The area is often referred to as The High Coast, hence its name. The bridge replaces Sandöbron, the old bridge across the river, in a new extension of the European route E4. It is (as of 2013) the third longest suspension bridge in Scandinavia (after Great Belt Fixed Link in Denmark and Hardanger Bridge in Norway), the fourth longest in Europe, and the 14th longest of the world. Total length 1,867 metres (6,125 ft), Width 17.8 metres (58 ft), Height 180 metres (591 ft), Longest span 1,210 metres (3,970 ft), Number of spans 1, Piers in water 2, Clearance below 40 metres (131 ft)."
