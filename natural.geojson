The¬†Northwest Angle¬†and the town of¬†Angle Township¬†can only be reached from the rest of Minnesota by crossing the lake or by traveling through¬†Canada. The Northwest Angle is the northern most part of the¬†contiguous United States. Its \"northwesternmost point\" served as a problematic landmark in treaties defining the international border. Lake of the Woods is fed by the Rainy River, Shoal Lake, Kakagi Lake and other smaller rivers. The lake drains into the Winnipeg River and then into Lake Winnipeg. Ultimately, its outflow goes north through the Nelson River to Hudson Bay. Lake of the Woods is over seventy miles long and wide, and contains more than 14,552 islands and 65,000 miles (105,000 km) of shoreline. It would amount to the longest coastline of any Canadian lake, except that the lake is not entirely within Canada. Lake of the Woods is also the sixth largest freshwater lake located (at least partially) in the United States, after the five Great Lakes. Surface area 1,679 sq mi (4,348.6 km2), Max. depth 210 ft (64 m)."
