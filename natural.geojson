The¬†Northwest Angle¬†and the town of¬†Angle Township¬†can only be reached from the rest of Minnesota by crossing the lake or by traveling through¬†Canada. The Northwest Angle is the northern most part of the¬†contiguous United States. Its \"northwesternmost point\" served as a problematic landmark in treaties defining the international border. Lake of the Woods is fed by the Rainy River, Shoal Lake, Kakagi Lake and other smaller rivers. The lake drains into the Winnipeg River and then into Lake Winnipeg. Ultimately, its outflow goes north through the Nelson River to Hudson Bay. Lake of the Woods is over seventy miles long and wide, and contains more than 14,552 islands and 65,000 miles (105,000 km) of shoreline. It would amount to the longest coastline of any Canadian lake, except that the lake is not entirely within Canada. Lake of the Woods is also the sixth largest freshwater lake located (at least partially) in the United States, after the five Great Lakes. Surface area 1,679 sq mi (4,348.6 km2), Max. depth 210 ft (64 m)."

The lake has a winding coastline and many peninsulas and islands. In 1970, two hydroelectric power plants were built on the Voronya River at Serebryansk, about 100 kilometers downstream from the lake. The dam at the power plant created a reservoir on the Voronya with the same waterlevel as Lake Lovozero, effectively turning the two bodies of water into one."

Approximately 60 km long and 40 km wide, the lake is surrounded by extensive wetlands. There is a large island in the middle of the lake called Chisi Island. The lake has no outlet, and the level of water is greatly affected by seasonal rains and summer evaporation. In 1968, the lake disappeared during exceptionally dry weather. When David Livingstone visited the lake in 1859, he reported that its southern boundary reached as far as the Mulanje Massif, which would have made the lake at least 20 miles longer than it is today."

Its major tributaries are the Kara Irtysh (Black Irtysh) and Kendyrlyk from the east; its only outlet is the Irtysh River (or White Irtysh). The lake is generally frozen from the beginning of November to the end of April, but still has an abundance of fish. Since the construction of the Bukhtarma dam on the Irtysh downstream from the Zaysan, the lake has risen 6 m (20 ft) above its natural level. "

Lake Shinji-ko is connected to the Sea of Japan via Nakaumi Lagoon, and as a result is made up of brackish water of good quality, which adds to the abundance of aquatic life, such as whitebait, eel, sea bass, and the most famous Lake Shinji-ko delicacy, the Shijimi clam."
